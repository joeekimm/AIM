    When I graduated from Musicians Institute in 2010, I had no idea what it'd take to get to where I'm at.
    Before the fancy titles like multi-platinum and GRAMMY-winning, my professional career as an audio engineer was anything but promising.
    Whether I was picking up trash and cleaning restrooms as an unpaid intern, delivering food as a minimum wage runner, or working 90-hour weeks as an established freelancer, my success has been based on a series of choices.
    Every breakthrough moment came from taking a chance, and if there's one thing I've learned over the past decade, fear is a direction more than it is a feelingâ€”let it guide you.
    My passion for music has taken me around the world and put me in the same room as some of my idols.
    It's a privilege to help fellow creatives execute their vision, and audio engineering is an art; I treat it as such.
